# Creating a Lua Mod

First off, to create a lua mod, we need to head into the dir where we have UE4SS installed, and go inside of the `Mods` folder. 

In that folder, let's create a new folder called `TestLuaInteropMod`.

Open this folder, and create:

import { FaFile, FaFolder } from "react-icons/fa";

* <FaFile/> File `enabled.txt` - this file is used to tell ue4ss that your mod should be enabled

* <FaFolder/> Folder `Scripts` - this will store all our lua scripts of the mod

Open the `Scripts` folder, and create a `main.lua` file. This file will be the entrypoint of our mod, and we will do all of our logic here.

:::note
You can have your scripts spread over multiple files, but this will not be covered in this tutorial
:::

Your folder structure should now look like this:

Now open your `main.lua` file in your favorite code editor, and let's actually write some code!
