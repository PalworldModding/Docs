# Character Customization Colors

**Guide written by: `Dytser`**

## Material Slots
Skin and hair color is controlled by the materials on the models.  
Specifically their "material slot names".  

### Materials
| Name | Material Slot name |
| ---- | ---- |
| Hair | MS_Hair |
| Skin | MS_Body |
| Outfit | MS_Cloth |

Skin on both face and Body uses the same material slot name.  
Material on Hair and Brow is likely the same *Needs confirmation*  

### Fixing Material Slot Names
Double-click your model in Unreal Engine and then on the top left you can see all materials used in the model (these will be the same materials you have in blender), change the name of their material slots.  

### Example on Cloth armor
