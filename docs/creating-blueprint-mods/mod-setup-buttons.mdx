  - Next add a `Switch on Int` action, connected to the `ModMenuButtonPressed` event.
    - For every single button you wish to have, you will add a pin to this `Switch On Int`
    - Your pin's must match up to `ModButtons String Array` ![ModButtonSwitchOnInt](./assets/ModSwitchOnEvent.png)
    - When a `ModButton` is clicked, it will send a Execute signal, through which every integer is connected to it.
