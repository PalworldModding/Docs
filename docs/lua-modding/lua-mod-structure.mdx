# Lua Mod Structure

Now that we have our tools set up, to create a lua mod, we need to head into `Mods` folder of our workspace. 

In that folder, let's create a new folder called `TestLuaInteropMod`.

In this folder create:

import { FaFile, FaFolder } from "react-icons/fa";

* <FaFile/> File `enabled.txt` - this file is used to tell ue4ss that your mod should be enabled

* <FaFolder/> Folder `Scripts` - this will store all our lua scripts of the mod

Open the `Scripts` folder, and create a `main.lua` file. This file will be the entrypoint of our mod, and we will do all of our logic here.

:::note
You can have your scripts spread over multiple files, an example will be covered later in the tutorial
:::

Your folder structure should now look like this:

![Mod Structure](./assets/ModStructure.png)

Now open the `main.lua` file, and let's actually write some code!
