# Config Files
Now that you have a working base area mod, you could technically just release that as is and have people change the value in the main file. But that's lame and it's nice to provide a config file for better user experience. So here's a real brief lesson on that (which also doubles as an example on how to use separate files)

We can real simply add a `config.lua` file to our `/Scripts` folder, and then call that in our `main.lua` file, like so:

`config.lua`
```lua
local _my_mod_config = {
    -- You can add comments with default values and such
    -- Usually some explanation of what it does etc
    area_range = 3500.0
}
return _my_mod_config
```

`main.lua`
```lua
local config = require "config"

NotifyOnNewObject("/Script/Pal.PalBaseCampModel", function(base_model)
    print("found a base model, waiting for it to finish initializing")
    ExecuteWithDelay(10000, function()
        base_model.AreaRange = config.area_range
        print("changed a bases range")
    end)
end)
```

That's it!
