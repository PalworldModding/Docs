# Packing a Lua Mod
Packing a Lua-only mod is super simple.

For the most part, any mod site is just going to want you to upload a `.zip` version of your `/SuperFancyMod` folder. 

So in our example, you would just right-click your `TestLuaInteropMod` folder and zip it up with whatever zipping tool you prefer.

That's it! Distribution is that simple.
