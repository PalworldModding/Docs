# Introduction

With Palworld's 0.7.0 update, we now have Steam Workshop support for the game! This means that installing and creating mods has become a much easier process.

:::warning
Workshop is only available for the Steam version of the game!

You might be asking, "Is there a dedicated modding API in Palworld now?" and the answer to that is no. Pocketpair wanted to respect the existing modding ecosystem, which means we'll still be using UE4SS and other existing frameworks.

If you're not familiar with how Steam Workshop works, but you want to install mods, don't worry, because we will be going through the full process from installing mods and enabling them to uninstalling or disabling them!
