# TLDR Quick Guide

I get it, you're in a hurry, work starts in 20 minutes, there's a fire next door (WHY ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT WORKSHOP? GET TO SAFETY) etc. so here's a quick guide.

1. Open Steam Library, select Palworld and click on Workshop in the right side of the tab section under the big green play button.

2. Look for the mods you want to use, click on **"Subscribe"** which is equivalent to Download. If there's dependencies, they will be downloaded with the mod if you select **"Subscribe to All"** in the popup that happens after Subscribing.

3. After choosing your mods, they will not work yet. Launch Palworld and in title screen go to Options > Mod Management and set **"Enable Mod"** to **ON**.

4. There will be a checkbox next to each mod. Checked means the mod is enabled, unchecked means it is disabled. Check the mods you want to use and hit **"Save"**. The game will now restart and your mods should now be enabled.

If you had UE4SS previously downloaded from NexusMods or some other source and you installed UE4SS from workshop either as a dependency or by itself, make absolutely sure to delete **dwmapi.dll** in `Palworld\Pal\Binaries\Win64` or you **WILL EXPERIENCE CRASHING** after launching the game.

If a mod you subscribed to isn't working, make sure you have subscribed to that mod's dependencies.
