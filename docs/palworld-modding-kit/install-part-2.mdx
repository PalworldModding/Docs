# PDK Setup & Config - Part 2

With the prerequisites out of the way, we are ready to download the sdk.

## Repository Setup

There are two ways to set up the repository:

* Cloning from git
* Downloading a zip

Cloning from git has the advantage of easier updates, but requires knowledge of git. This guide will explore both options.

### Cloning from git

To clone the repository from git, use this link: https://github.com/localcc/PalworldModdingKit.

Using `git clone` run:

```bash title="Git"
git clone https://github.com/localcc/PalworldModdingKit
```

### Downloading a zip

If you're not using git, you can download the zip using the button below:

import GitHubButton from '@site/src/components/GitHubButton';

<GitHubButton text="Download PDK" url="https://github.com/localcc/PalworldModdingKit/archive/HEAD.zip"/>

After downloading the zip file, unpack it.

### Checking

After downloading the repo, you should see the following file structure:

![Repo Structure](./assets/RepoStructure.png)

## Wwise integration

:::warning
Before continuing to open the sdk in unreal, we must integrate Wwise manually. This is because the Wwise version that the game uses, is not officially compatible with the engine version, so we have to manually copy it over.
:::

1) Open the directory you downloaded offline installation files for Wwise in ( [Back at the end of Part1](./install-part-1#finished) ), you should see the following structure:

![Offline installation files structure](./assets/WwiseOfflineIntegrationStructure.png)

2) Unpack the `Unreal.5.0.tar.xz` archive.

:::note
You might need to do it twice, first time you unpack it, you might get a .tar file, unpack that one too.
:::

import { FaFile, FaFolder } from "react-icons/fa";

3) Copy over the unpacked `Wwise` Folder ( <FaFolder/> ) into the `Plugins` folder of the Palworld Modding Kit.

4) Almost done with Wwise integration, now we just need to copy over the needed dlls.

5) Open the `Plugins\Wwise` Folder ( <FaFolder/> ) inside the Palworld Modding Kit, and create a `ThirdParty` folder there.

6) Now go to the Folder ( <FaFolder/> ) where you installed the Wwise SDK

:::warning
This is not the folder where you installed the integration files, but the folder where you installed the SDK
:::

```text title="Default Wwise SDK Path"
C:\Program Files (x86)\Audiokinetic\Wwise 2021.1.11.7933\SDK
```

Inside of this Folder ( <FaFolder/> ), select:

* `Win32_vc170`
* `x64_vc170`
* `include`

7) Copy over the Folders ( <FaFolder/> ) listed above to the `ThirdParty` folder you created earlier.

8) After copying over those folders, make sure to duplicate the `vc170` folders as `vc160` also, so the structure will look as follows:

![VC160 Copies](./assets/Vc160Incident.png)

:::info
If you continue without the following change, you will have to click OK on a dialog box that says Wwise is not compatible with the current Unreal Engine version every time you load up the editor.


To fix this, navigate to `Plugins\Wwise` and open `Wwise.uplugin` with any text editor or ide. 

Then change the entry `"EngineVersion" : "5.0.0",` to `"EngineVersion" : "5.1",`.
:::

### Finished

Yay! Now we are done with integrating wwise!

## Changing build tools from VS 2019 to VS 2022
In Unreal Engine 5.1, by default, Visual Studio 2019 build tools will be used if they are installed.

:::warning
The below changes should only be made if Visual Studio 2019 is installed alongside Visual Studio 2022.
:::

<details>
    <summary>If you don't see "Unreal Engine" in `%APPDATA%`</summary>
    <div>
        If you don't see "Unreal Engine" in `%APPDATA%` that means you haven't launched Unreal Engine before<br/>
        Go to `Epic Games Launcher -> Unreal Engine -> Library 0 >` Click "Launch" on the Unreal Engine version that you've downloaded (5.1.x).<br/>
        ![UnrealEditorLaunchFirst](./assets/LaunchUnrealEditor.png)<br/>
        Let it load until you see the creation of a new project screen then close it and continue with the guide.<br/>
    </div>
</details>

To change this, navigate to `%APPDATA%\Unreal Engine\UnrealBuildTool` and open `BuildConfiguration.xml` with your favorite XML editor.


```xml title="Initial Configuration"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Configuration xmlns="https://www.unrealengine.com/BuildConfiguration">
</Configuration>
```


```xml title="Updated it to look like so:"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Configuration xmlns="https://www.unrealengine.com/BuildConfiguration">
    <VCProjectFileGenerator>
        <Version>VisualStudio2022</Version>
    </VCProjectFileGenerator>
    <WindowsPlatform>
        <Compiler>VisualStudio2022</Compiler>
    </WindowsPlatform>
</Configuration>
```

:::tip
Congratulations on making it through the configuration!
