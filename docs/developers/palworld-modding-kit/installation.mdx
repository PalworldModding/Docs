# Installation

With the prerequisites out of the way, we are ready to download and install the Palworld Modding Kit (PMK).

## Repository Setup

There are two ways to set up the repository:

* Cloning from git
* Downloading a zip

Cloning from git has the advantage of easier updates, but requires knowledge of git. This guide will explore both options.

### Cloning from git

To clone the repository from git, use this link: https://github.com/localcc/PalworldModdingKit.

Using `git clone` run:

```bash title="Git"
git clone https://github.com/localcc/PalworldModdingKit
```

### Downloading a zip

If you're not using git, you can download the zip using the button below:

import GitHubButton from '@site/src/components/GitHubButton';

<GitHubButton text="Download PMK" url="https://github.com/localcc/PalworldModdingKit/archive/HEAD.zip"/>

After downloading the zip file, unpack it.

### Checking

After downloading the repo, you should see the following file structure:

![Repo Structure](./assets/RepoStructure.png)

## Wwise integration

:::warning
Before continuing to open the Modding Kit in Unreal, we must integrate Wwise manually. This is because the Wwise version that the game uses, is not officially compatible with the engine version, so we have to manually copy it over.
:::

1) Open the directory you downloaded offline installation files for Wwise in ( [Back at the end of Prerequisites](./prerequisites#next-steps) ), you should see the following structure:

![Offline installation files structure](./assets/WwiseOfflineIntegrationStructure.png)

2) Unpack the `Unreal.5.0.tar.xz` archive.

:::note
You might need to do it twice, first time you unpack it, you might get a .tar file, unpack that one too.
:::

import { FaFile, FaFolder } from "react-icons/fa";

3) Copy over the unpacked `Wwise` Folder ( <FaFolder/> ) into the `Plugins` folder of the Palworld Modding Kit.

4) Almost done with Wwise integration, now we just need to copy over the needed dlls.

5) Open the `Plugins\Wwise` Folder ( <FaFolder/> ) inside the Palworld Modding Kit, and create a `ThirdParty` folder there.

6) Now go to the Folder ( <FaFolder/> ) where you installed the Wwise SDK

:::warning
This is not the folder where you installed the integration files, but the folder where you installed the SDK
:::

```text title="Default Wwise SDK Path"
C:\Program Files (x86)\Audiokinetic\Wwise 2021.1.11.7933\SDK
```

Inside of this Folder ( <FaFolder/> ), select:

* `Win32_vc170`
* `x64_vc170`
* `include`

7) Copy over the Folders ( <FaFolder/> ) listed above to the `ThirdParty` folder you created earlier.

8) After copying over those folders, make sure to duplicate the `vc170` folders as `vc160` also, so the structure will look as follows:

![VC160 Copies](./assets/ThirdParty.png)

:::info
If you continue without the following change, you will have to click OK on a dialog box that says Wwise is not compatible with the current Unreal Engine version every time you load up the editor.


To fix this, navigate to `Plugins\Wwise` and open `Wwise.uplugin` with any text editor or ide. 

Then change the entry `"EngineVersion" : "5.0.0",` to `"EngineVersion" : "5.1",`.
:::

### Finished

Yay! We are now done with integrating Wwise!

## Changing build tools from VS 2019 to VS 2022
In Unreal Engine 5.1, by default, Visual Studio 2019 build tools will be used if they are installed. It is recommended that you do this step to make sure your project compiles without errors.

To change this, navigate to `%APPDATA%\Unreal Engine\UnrealBuildTool` and open `BuildConfiguration.xml` with your preferred text editor.

<details>
    <summary>If you don't see "Unreal Engine" in `%APPDATA%` (click me)</summary>
    <div>
        If you don't see "Unreal Engine" in `%APPDATA%` that means you haven't launched Unreal Engine before<br/>
        Go to `Epic Games Launcher -> Unreal Engine -> Library 0 >` Click "Launch" on the Unreal Engine version that you've downloaded (5.1.x).<br/>
        ![UnrealEditorLaunchFirst](./assets/LaunchUnrealEditor.png)<br/>
        Let it load until you see the creation of a new project screen then close it and continue with the guide.<br/>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>If you need help finding BuildConfiguration.xml (click me)</summary>
    <div>
        Copy the string `%APPDATA%\Unreal Engine\UnrealBuildTool` to clipboard, open the Start Menu by clicking on the Windows icon and then pressing Ctrl+V which now should show you a folder that you can select and it'll take you to where `BuildConfiguration.xml` is located.

        ![](./assets/BuildConfiguration.png)
    </div>
</details>

```xml title="Initial Configuration"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Configuration xmlns="https://www.unrealengine.com/BuildConfiguration">
</Configuration>
```


```xml title="Update it to look like so:"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Configuration xmlns="https://www.unrealengine.com/BuildConfiguration">
    <VCProjectFileGenerator>
        <Version>VisualStudio2022</Version>
    </VCProjectFileGenerator>
    <WindowsPlatform>
        <Compiler>VisualStudio2022</Compiler>
        <CompilerVersion>14.38.33130</CompilerVersion>
        <ToolchainVersion>14.38.33130</ToolchainVersion>
    </WindowsPlatform>
</Configuration>
```

## Launching the Project

Congratulations on making it through the configuration! You're now ready to launch the project by double-clicking the `Pal.uproject` file. You might think nothing is happening, but when you're launching the project for the first time, it has to compile first which takes a while depending on your computers specifications, so be patient.

If you did everything correctly, then you should see the Unreal Editor splash screen once it's done compiling, otherwise it'll show "Pal could not be compiled" if something went wrong during one of the steps.

:::note
If it tells you that modules are out of date and need to be recompiled, press **YES**
:::

:::warning
Windows REALLY hates long file paths. **If it continues to tell you that modules need to be recompiled, your file path may be too long.**
This will be especially true if you downloaded the ZIP instead of using git clone. Try renaming the
`palworldmoddingkit` folder, and removing the `-` and everything after it. You can also try moving it closer to the root
of your drive.
:::

:::warning
Wwise will complain about not being compatible with the current Unreal Engine version every single time you start, click **YES**
:::

:::warning
If the file doesn't open in unreal engine and instead asks you for associations, open Unreal Engine, and open the file from there instead

:::note
You may see a popup on launch about Wwise project path issues, ignore it and press the X in the corner to close the popup.
