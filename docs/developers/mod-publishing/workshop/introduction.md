# Introduction

Palworld's 0.7.0 update brings Steam Workshop support to the game which means we can now upload our mods to the workshop! This doesn't mean that we have an official API for modding, but rather we'll still be using the old systems (UE4SS, etc) since the developers wanted to respect the existing modding ecosystem that is already in place.

:::warning
This feature is exclusive to Steam which means other versions of Palworld will still be modded the old way.

## Why should I use Steam Workshop?

Palworld's Workshop implementation is currently easier for the end-user than the alternatives and it also handles dependencies much better. Packaging process is much cleaner as well.
